      "The United States had been providing military aid and economic assistance to Pakistan for various purposes since 1948. Recently U.S. stopped military aid to Pakistan, which was about US$2 billion per year. With U.S. military assistance suspended in 2018 and civilian aid reduced to about $300 million for 2022, Pakistani authorities have turned to other countries for help.\n",

      "== History ==\n",
      "From 1947 to 1958, under civilian leadership, the United States provided Pakistan with modest economic aid and limited military assistance. During this period, Pakistan became a member of the South East Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO) and the Central Treaty Organization (CENTO), after a Mutual Defence Assistance Agreement signed in May 1954, which facilitated increased levels of both economic and military aid from the U.S.\n",
      "In 1958, Ayub Khan led Pakistan's first military coup, becoming Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and later President until 1969. During his tenure, the U.S. delivered substantial economic and military aid, despite Pakistan's governance by military regime, and amidst events like the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965.\n",
      "Yahya Khan succeeded Ayub in 1969, holding power during the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 which led to the secession of East Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh. Under Yahya, the U.S. provided adequate economic but minimal military aid.\n",
      "Civilian governance of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto resumed from 1971 to 1977, during which the U.S. offered modest economic support and withheld military aid as Pakistan finalized its constitution, establishing a parliamentary democracy.\n",
      "Following another military coup in 1977, Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq led the country. In April 1979, President Jimmy Carter halted all aid, excluding food assistance, due to Pakistan's efforts to establish a uranium enrichment facility, following Symington Amendment. Initial U.S. aid was limited, increasing significantly after geopolitical shifts such as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and the fall of the Shah of Iran. U.S. sanctions imposed in April 1979 due to Pakistan's nuclear activities were lifted by the end of the year in light of these events.\n",
      "Between 1988 and 1999, under civilian and democratic governments, U.S. aid was low, particularly after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989. The aid was suspended in the 1990s under President George H. W. Bush, who cited concerns over Pakistan's developing nuclear program. Relations between the two countries deteriorated as the U.S. implemented the Pressler Amendment. This amendment led to severe sanctions against Pakistan, exacerbating economic challenges for the country's nascent civilian government. Consequently, all forms of bilateral aid from the U.S. to Pakistan were halted. The once expansive operations of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in Pakistan, which had employed over 1,000 staff across the country, were dramatically reduced almost overnight. Further complications arose from U.S. sanctions following Pakistan's nuclear tests in 1998, which were conducted in response to similar tests by India.\n",
      "The return of military rule under Pervez Musharraf from 1999 to 2008 initially saw little U.S. economic or military aid. However, following the September 11, 2001 attacks, all U.S. sanctions were removed, and Pakistan, having aligned with the U.S. in the War on Terror, received substantial increases in both economic and military assistance.\n",
      "On June 16, 2009, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Enhanced Partnership with Pakistan Act of 2009, commonly referred to as the Kerry-Lugar Bill. The bipartisan act authorized an annual provision of $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Pakistan, aimed at fostering enhanced bilateral relations.\n",
      "In 2011, the Obama administration suspended more than one-third of all military assistance, totaling approximately $800 million due to Osama bin Laden-related controversy. This reduction encompassed funds designated for military hardw...\n",

      "The Dominion of Pakistan, officially Pakistan, was an independent federal dominion in the British Commonwealth of Nations, which existed from 14 August 1947 to 23 March 1956. It was created by the passing of the Indian Independence Act 1947 by the British parliament, which also created an independent Dominion of India.\n",
      "The new dominion consisted of those presidencies and provinces of British India which were allocated to it in the Partition of India. Until 1947, these regions had been ruled by the United Kingdom as a part of the British Empire.\n",
      "Its status as a federal dominion within the British Empire ended in 1956 with the completion of the Constitution of Pakistan, which established the country as a republic. The constitution also administratively split the nation into West Pakistan and East Pakistan. Until then, these provinces had been governed as a singular entity, despite being separate geographic exclaves. Eventually, the East became Bangladesh and the West became Pakistan.\n",
      "During the year that followed its independence, the new country was joined by the princely states of Pakistan, which were ruled by princes who had previously been in subsidiary alliances with the British. These states acceded to Pakistan one by one as their rulers signed Instruments of Accession. For many years, these states enjoyed a special status within the dominion and later the republic, but they were slowly incorporated into the provinces. The last remnants of their internal self-government were lost by 1974.\n",

      "Section 1 of the Indian Independence Act 1947 provided that from \"the fifteenth day of August, nineteen hundred and forty-seven, two independent dominions shall be set up in India, to be known respectively as India and Pakistan.\"  Muslims had been pushing for their own state since at least 1940 (see the Lahore resolution), believing they would become second-class citizens in a Hindu-majority India otherwise. The British monarch became the head of state of both the new dominions, with Pakistan sharing a king with the United Kingdom and the other dominions of the British Commonwealth, and the monarch's constitutional roles in Pakistan were delegated to the Governor-General of Pakistan.\n",
      "Before August 1947, about half of the area of present-day Pakistan was part of British India, which was directly governed by the British in the name of the British Crown, while the remainder were princely states in subsidiary alliances with the British, enjoying semi-autonomous self-government. The British abandoned these alliances in August 1947, leaving the states entirely independent, and between 1947 and 1948 the states all acceded to Pakistan, while retaining internal self-government for several years.\n",
      "More than ten million people migrated across the new borders and between 200,000 and 2,000,000 people died in the spate of communal violence in the Punjab in what some scholars have described as a 'retributive genocide' between the religions. The Pakistani government claimed that 50,000 Muslim women were abducted and raped by Hindu and Sikh men and similarly the Indian government claimed that Muslims abducted and raped 33,000 Hindu and Sikh women. The two governments agreed to repatriate abducted women and thousands of Hindu, Sikh and Muslim women were repatriated to their families in the 1950s. The dispute over Kashmir escalated into the first war between India and Pakistan. With the assistance of the United Nations (UN) the war was ended but it became the Kashmir dispute, unresolved as of 2024.\n",

Mountbatten had offered to serve as Governor-general of both India and Pakistan but Jinnah refused this offer.\n",
